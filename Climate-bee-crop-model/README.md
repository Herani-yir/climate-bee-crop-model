 üåç Climate Change Impact on Wild Bee and Crop Interaction

This project is based on my master's thesis conducted at AIMS Cameroon. It presents a mechanistic model that explores the impact of climate change on the mutualistic relationship between wild bee populations and crop production, using Python-based simulations.

 üìö Project Overview

Building on the foundational work of Carturan et al., this model captures the dynamics of bumble bee colony populations and their critical role in pollination services. It provides insights into the optimal wildflower-to-crop planting ratio based on factors such as:

- Wildflower blooming periods  
- Nutritional quality of floral resources  
- Bee foraging efficiency on crop vs wildflowers  

The model uses real-world data to reflect demographic processes, foraging behavior, and floral visitation patterns in agricultural systems.

 üß™ Key Findings

- A multi-seasonal planting strategy that avoids overlap between wildflower and crop blooming periods results in increased crop yields.
- Introducing attractive wildflower resources before the crop bloom generates a temporal spillover effect, improving pollination services.
- The model highlights the vulnerability of pollinators to climate change, emphasizing the need for sustainable planting strategies that enhance ecosystem resilience and food security.
